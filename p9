# Here are the key observations from the box plot of age distribution with respect to gender and survival status:  

# 1. Median Age Differences:
#    - The median age of male passengers is higher than that of female passengers.  
#    - Among survivors, the median age is slightly lower, indicating younger passengers had a better chance of survival.  

# 2. Gender-Based Survival Trends: 
#    - Female passengers, across all age groups, had a higher survival rate than males.  
#    - Many younger females survived, supporting the notion that women and children were prioritized during evacuation.  

# 3. Survival Among Males:  
#    - A significant portion of young male passengers survived, while older males had a lower survival rate.  
#    - The survival rate for older men was much lower, showing they were not given priority during rescue efforts.  

# 4. Outliers and Age Variations: 
#    - There are a few outliers, especially in the age distribution of survivors, suggesting that some older passengers also survived despite the trend.  
#    - The spread of ages among male passengers is broader than that of females.  

#  Inference:  
# - Women and children were more likely to survive** due to evacuation protocols.  
# - Older male passengers had the lowest survival rates**, possibly due to prioritization of women and younger individuals.  
# - Young male survivors were mostly children, reinforcing the "children first" policy.
